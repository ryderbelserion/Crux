## What about X Minecraft version?
You need a program like 7zip, NanaZip or PeaZip, and be on a version of Paper that includes their plugin management system(paper-plugin.yml)

1) Download the jar file you want.
2) Open the jar file in 7zip, NanaZip or PeaZip.
3) Open paper-plugin.yml
4) Edit api-version to the Minecraft version you want (or remove the field all together to allow itt to boot on any version.)
   1) Note, I am not going to provide support if there is an error related to using it on an older version
5) Save the paper-plugin.yml
6) Save the jar file
7) Throw in your plugins folder, and hit start server.
